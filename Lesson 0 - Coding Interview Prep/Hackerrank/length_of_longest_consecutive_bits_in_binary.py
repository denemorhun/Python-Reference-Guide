# Convert decimal to binary
# count length of the longest consecutive bits
'''
if we a bitwise AND with a bit sequence of a shifted version of itself,
weâ€™re removing the trailing 1 from every sequence of consecutive 1s.

      11101111   (x)
    & 11011110   (x << 1)
    ----------
      11001110   (x & (x << 1)) 
        ^    ^
        |    |
   trailing 1 removed

The operation x = (x & (x << 1)) reduces length of every 
sequence of 1s by one in binary representation of x. 
If we repeat this operation in a loop, we end up with x = 0. 

The number of iterations required to reach 0 is length of the 
longest consecutive sequence of 1s.
